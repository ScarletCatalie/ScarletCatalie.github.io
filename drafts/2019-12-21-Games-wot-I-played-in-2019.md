It's December, 2019. I'm exhausted.

This year was a lot, readers. I've been running on fumes since January, and it took some bad news last month to realise just how exhausting it's been.

I couldn't put together an actual, capital-GOTY Game Of The Year list for 2019 if I tried. I think I maybe played, at a stretch, *eight* new games this year. I'm sure that Star Wars lark was fun. The Outer Worlds/Wilds looks way better than The Outer Wilds/Worlds. But between jetting off to events, quitting jobs, moving my PC across town and diving back into the freelance furnace, I didn't keep up with games well in 2019.

Not that I didn't like. Play games, at all. Don't be daft. Here's a wee rundown of the games (old and new) that got me through this wild-ass year.

<h3>The Year Of The Mech</h3>

2019 was a year for giant robots. We launched <a href="https://itch.io/b/343/can-androids-pray">our own sad mech game</a> in July, sure - an existential drama that left plenty of folk crying and shaking when trying it out at shows. A roaring success, then.

In 2019, I spent way more time in other people's cockpits. I finally checked out Neon Genesis Evangelion, when its Netflix release brought the discourse screaming onto my feed. More importantly, I returned to Harebrained Schemes' BattleTech, picking up the season pass and bringing a full Career to completion.

What a game, y'all. Now complete, BattleTech is a phenomenal package. Urban missions present new tactical opportunities, where movement is never a given and cover never permanent. I picked up the Bull Shark, HBS' bespoke new Assault mech, at the very end of my run - the game rewarding my hard work with an absolute bastard of a 'bot that can turn foes to scrap with a look.

It shines brighter in comparison to Piranha Games' MechWarrior 5. I so, dearly wanted to love MW5 but it's a lifeless affair. Generic butt-rock accompanyies too-visible tile-based terrain, forcing you into the role of a tepid fart of a protagonist embarking on a revenge plot pulled from any PS2 game. Worse still, it doesn't even support the Steel Battalion controller.

Ah, well. At least walking through tower blocks is always a lark.

<h3>Squidtoons 2</h3>

I caved. I finally bought a Switch. The Lite looks well cute in banana yellow, and there was a hyper-stylish new Mech game out in Daemon X Machina. In hindsight, I don't really rate DXM (it's fun as hell, but the story is forced and throwaway), but the Switch? It's pretty bloody good, lads.

There were some bangers in the first few weeks. Untitled Goose Game is honkin' great, and I can't undersell how wild it is to play Thumper on a bus (please don't *only* play Thumper on a bus, but if you can, play Thumper on a bus). Someone lent me Breath Of The Wild and yeah, y'all were right about that one. One week, though, I picked up a wee game called Splatoon 2.

I haven't been seen since.

I'd kinda given up on finding a new, *good* team shooter to obsess over. Something to completely devour me in the way Hawken or Super Monday Night Combat did back in the day. Splatoon is phenomenal, a hectic upbeat 4v4 party that combines momentum and map control in one simple mechanic. It's impossible to watch but a joy to play - and hey, when has that ever stopped Overwatch?

Splatoon filled the empty space in my heart once occupied by Jet Set Radio, an urban battleground driven by music and packed with fashion. It's a weird and wild world to exist in, and I've taken to just popping into empty maps to soak in the atmosphere. Splatoon's singleplayer campaigns don't quite carry that vibe, but they're wildly creative nonetheless. Agent 4's story is Super Mario Galaxy with guns. Octo Expansion is that, but... Portal?  

It's ignited a joy that would've had 18-year-old Tumblr Nat neck-deep in fandom. Bitter, tired 25-year-old Twitter Nat is just along for the ride. I'm furious at myself for not having picked it up earlier.

On that count, Splatoon 2 isn't alone.

<h3>Respawn make good games. huh.</h3>

No, I didn't play the Jedi game.

Why would I want to, anyway? Callum Starwars' lightsabre adventure looks fine and all, but I've plenty of Respawn to get my fill this year. On track with Splatoon 2, I didn't get into Titanfall 2 until early this year.

Big mistake, lads. Turns out parkour-running, mech-gunning team shootin' action is entirely my shit? I got into Titanfall 2 around the time Apex Legends dropped, along with thousands of new pilots who wanted to see what they'd missed first time around.

Here's a take, though. That campaign? It's okay. It's... fine. 6/10. Standards for singleplayer shooters must've been awful in 2016, because while the novelty levels are neat, the real belters are few and far between. They're also not enough to hold up how naff the setting is - a beautiful, mil-tech sci-fi world with absolutely no character behind its main actors.

It took Apex to turn the Frontier into something with character - just enough to add some devilishly fun characters into the Respawn battle royale. ApeLegs is probably the 2019 game I spent the most time with in 2019. I'd missed the BR craze - PUBG was pricey and dour-looking, while Fortnite moves too fast to keep up with.

Apex, though? It's brill. Wallrunning and mechs aren't missed when you're sliding down hillsides and vaulting entire buildings. It keeps delivering, too. The latest map blew King's Canyon out of the water. Halloween resurrected Halo 3 zombies and revived Titanfall's dropship escapes. I've taken time away (for uh... squid reasons) but I'm pumped as hell to see what's next.
