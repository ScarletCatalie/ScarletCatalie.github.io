It's December, 2019. I'm exhausted.

This year was a lot, readers. I've been running on fumes since January, and it took some bad news last month to realise just how exhausting it's been.

I couldn't put together an actual, capital-GOTY Game Of The Year list for 2019 if I tried. I think I maybe played, at a stretch, *eight* new games this year. I'm sure that Star Wars lark was fun. The Outer Worlds/Wilds looks way better than The Outer Wilds/Worlds. But between jetting off to events, quitting jobs, moving my PC across town and diving back into the freelance furnace, I didn't keep up with games well in 2019.




<h3>The Year Of The Mech</h3>

2019 was a year for giant robots. We launched <a href="https://itch.io/b/343/can-androids-pray">our own sad mech game</a> in July, sure.

<h3>Respawn make good games. huh.</h3>


<h3>To all the Itch games I met along the way</h3>
