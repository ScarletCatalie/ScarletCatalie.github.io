<p>You can find most of my previous freelance writing at Rock Paper Shotgun, VICE Games and VG247, with more well good words over at Kotaku, PC Gamer, PCGamesN, Eurogamer and Polygon. 
	There's a lot of it, so I've gone and highlighted the best bits over <a href="https://scarletcatalie.github.io/about">here</a></p>

<p>I occasionally make games, including existentially-horrifying mech drama <i>Can Androids Pray</i>, while my grubby mitts have also touched bigger titles like <i>Alien: Isolation</i> and <i>Minecraft: Console Editions</i>.
	As a solo artist I've been forced into more generalist roles, but I specialise in narrative and environment/level design, and have a deep familiarity with first-person and multiplayer games.</p>

<p>Don't tell Respawn, but I also unofficially appear in Apex Legends under the pseudonym "Horizon". Here's my mug.</p>
