<p>I writes words about video games online, for money. Fancy that.</p>

<p>You can find most of my writing in Rock Paper Shotgun, VICE Games and VG247, with more well good words over at Kotaku, PC Gamer, PCGamesN, Eurogamer and Polygon. 
	There's a lot of it, so I've gone and highlighted the best bits over <a href="https://scarletcatalie.github.io/about">here</a></p>

<p>I also used to make games, including existentially-horrifying mech drama <i>Can Androids Pray</i>. 
My grubby mitts have also touched bigger titles like <i>Alien: Isolation</i> and <i>Minecraft: Console Editions</i>.</p>

<p>Here's my mug.</p>
