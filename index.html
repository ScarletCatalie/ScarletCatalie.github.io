	<h1>hey. i'm natalie clayton.</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a level designer with Inkle working on <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240060/A_Highland_Song>A Highland Song</a>.</p>
	
</div><!-- /.blurb -->

<p> For the past ten years, I've worked in and out of various roles across all levels of the games industryâ€”from QA on <i>Alien: Isolation</i> and level design on <i>Minecraft: Console Editions</i> to my own critically-acclaimed indie projects like <i>Can Androids Pray</i>. While I've worn dozens of hats, my passion lies in level design, creating gameplay spaces that tell stories and explore the frontiers of gameplay experiences.
	
<p> I'm also a recovering games journalist of five years, having written full time for PC Gamer and Rock Paper Shotgun, with bylines at Waypoint VICE, Kotaku, Eurogamer, Polygon and countless more.
	
<p> My games have been critically lauded by outlets like Waypoint VICE and Wireframe, and in 2018 I was listed in the GamesIndustry.biz 100 Rising Talent list and shortlisted for A Maze Berlin's Humble New Talent award.
