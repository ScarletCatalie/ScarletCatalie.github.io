	<h1>hey. i'm nat.</h1>

<p>I'm a "games" "person" based up in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>You can find my writing in Rock Paper Shotgun, VG247, Kotaku, PC Gamer, PCGamesN, Eurogamer and Polygon.</p>

<p>I develop tiny games, like existentially-horrifying mech drama <i>Can Androids Pray</i>. My grubby hands
have also touched bigger titles like <i>Alien: Isolation</i> and <i>Minecraft: Console Editions</i>.</p>

<p>GamesIndustry.Biz once called me a Rising Star in 2018. A MAZE Berlin / Humble shortlisted me for New Talent the same year. I think that's pretty cool.</p>

<p>Here's my face.</p>
