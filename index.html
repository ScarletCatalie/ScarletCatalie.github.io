<p>This is a collection of words, games and "stuff" created by Edinburgh-based games person Natalie Clayton.</p>
<p>My words have popped up in over a dozen outlets, like: Rock Paper Shotgun, VG247, PC Gamer, Kotaku, PCGamesN, Eurogamer and Polygon.</p>
<p>I'm also the developer of dozens of tiny games, including existentially-horrifying mech drama <i>Can Androids Pray</i>. My grubby fingerprints
have also touched bigger stuff, like <i>Alien: Isolation</i> and <i>Minecraft: Console Editions</i>.</p>

<p>Here's my face:</p>
