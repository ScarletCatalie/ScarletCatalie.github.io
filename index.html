<p>Nat writes words about video games online, for money. Fancy that.</p>

<p>You can find her writing in Rock Paper Shotgun, VG247, Kotaku, PC Gamer, PCGamesN, Eurogamer and Polygon. 
	There a lot of it, so she's only gone and highlighted the best bits over <a href="https://scarletcatalie.github.io/about">here</a></p>

<p>Nat also made a few tiny games, including existentially-horrifying mech drama <i>Can Androids Pray</i>. 
Her grubby mitts have also touched bigger titles like <i>Alien: Isolation</i> and <i>Minecraft: Console Editions</i>.</p>

<p>GamesIndustry.Biz once called her a Rising Star in 2018. A MAZE Berlin / Humble shortlisted her for New Talent the same year. She thinks that's pretty cool.</p>

<p>Here's her mug.</p>
