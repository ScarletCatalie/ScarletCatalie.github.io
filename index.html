	<h1>hey. i'm nat. from online.</h1>
</div><!-- /.blurb -->

<p>This is a collection of words, games and "stuff" created by Edinburgh-based games person Natalie Clayton.</p>

<p>My writing has popped up in over a dozen sites, including Rock Paper Shotgun, VG247, Kotaku, PC Gamer, PCGamesN, Eurogamer and Polygon. You might
have also caught my public speaking at A MAZE Berlin, Ludicious, Videobrains or elsewhere.</p>

<p>I develop tiny games about queers and robots and frogs. The best of these is existentially-horrifying mech drama <i>Can Androids Pray</i>. My grubby fingerprints
have also touched bigger stuff, like <i>Alien: Isolation</i> and <i>Minecraft: Console Editions</i>.</p>

<p>GamesIndustry.Biz once called me a Rising Star in 2018. A MAZE Berlin / Humble shortlisted me for New Talent the same year. I think that's pretty cool.</p>

<p>Here's my face.</p>
