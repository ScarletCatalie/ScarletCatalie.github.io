<p>You can find most of my previous freelance writing at Rock Paper Shotgun, VICE Games and VG247, with more well good words over at Kotaku, PC Gamer, PCGamesN, Eurogamer and Polygon. 
	There's a lot of it, so I've gone and highlighted the best bits over <a href="https://scarletcatalie.github.io/about">here</a></p>

<p>I used to make games, including existentially-horrifying mech drama <i>Can Androids Pray</i>. 
My grubby mitts have also touched bigger titles like <i>Alien: Isolation</i> and <i>Minecraft: Console Editions</i>.</p>

<p>Here's my mug.</p>
