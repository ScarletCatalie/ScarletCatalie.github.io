  	<p><i>"Beyond the veil, we come to an absolute rest, where our fears and worries no longer take shape. 
	  God or not, death provides a warm blanket for us to fall asleep under. 
	  It doesnâ€™t matter if androids can pray, as their reward will be the same as ours: leaving behind the turmoil of our world for the long sleep."</i>
