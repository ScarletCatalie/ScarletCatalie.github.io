title:  A Can Androids Pray Port-Mortem (Part 1)

*Can Androids Pray?* I'm not sure we  ever answered that. You'll have to buy the game to find out.

What I did manage was to develop, exhibit and release the largest game of my career. One month after release, and the sales are finally slowing down. So is my life, frankly. This year's been dominated by shows, exhibits, and nights throwing this game in front of an audience.

The reception has been wild. The stress has been real. I'm beyond proud of what the three of us accomplished.

With that in mind, I figured it's time for a little dive into how Can Androids Pray came to be.

## Opening Volley

We can't talk about *Can Androids Pray* without mentioning *Illal*. Back in early 2018, I was messing around with an open-world mech game. Learning to 3D model turned into learning to animate turned into plugging said animation into a whole new game.

It would have smashed *Where The Water Tastes Like Wine* into *Jalopy* by way of *HAWKEN*'s chunky mech design. A vehicular adventure where you'd take care of your mech while meeting strange folk with stranger stories.

*An early look at Project Illal, a third/first-person exploration game*

I got as far as plugging a flight stick into a half-baked build of *Illal* and taking it to a show in Dundee.

Despite this, I spent a lot of time explaining to folk (who had seen the game up there) that *Can Androids Pray* wasn't the same game. Maybe I'll go back to it. Who can say?

Ultimately, *Illal* was too ambitious. I didn't really know where to take it after that show. When Xalavier Nelson Jr approached me in April to collaborate, I didn't have much. But I did have a pile of mech assets, an established look, and a good sense of what I could reasonably develop.

I'd been looking for someone to collaborate with for months. At the time, I was making solo games through Patreon, but it was largely small works. Bitsy projects, Flightgames, stuff on that scale. Xalavier was (and still is) a writer I massively respected, but was also a pretty good pal. I was proper excited to make something with the guy.

We immediately set to work. Xalavier sent me draft after draft of a script, and I set about plugging it into Unity. Back then, I was using Inkle to turn his words into game logic, which was... fine. It was okay. Progress was getting made, the structure was set out. This was becoming real.

## The Long Dark

And then, nothing happened. For about eight months.

Work was a big'un - shortly after getting started on *Can Androids Pray*, I was hired as Staff Writer at PCGamesInsider. Turns out, it's hard to find time to work on games when you've got a 9-to-5!

But there were other reasons. Inkle was great enough for getting words into Unity, but it was a pain to alter or stylise in ways I wanted without diving into code. I could keep poking at the art, but without solid progress on the "game" bit of the game, it would have been energy poorly spent.

I wouldn't pick up development until January 2019. Following a bit of a rough winter and a creative slump, I was hit by a surge of creative energy. This game deserved making, and I needed to prove I could finish it.

*Now in Fungus, the game looks far closer to the final release*

This is where everything clicked into gear. Friendship ended with Inkle, now Fungus is my new friend. Fungus is a visual-novel tool for Unity that I found far better suited what we needed. Additionally, it came with light scripting elements that let me call changes to light, sound, scenes and that straight from the tool.

Thanks to the change, I was able to properly power through development. Getting the whole thing in one flowchart was tedious, sure, but I had the script implemented and ready for edits within a few weeks (my development process is not... intensive).

Xalavier had been busy too. Shortly after we kicked back into production, he started producing further refinements to the script. More importantly, he got us sounds. Reaching out to Priscilla Snow (an incredible musician who performs under Ghoulnoise), we quickly scored a score to elevate the game even further.

Now, we just had to finish the damn thing.
